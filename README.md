# Queue-Simmer
An R Shiny app that simulates one day in a call centre queue with Discrete-Event Simulation.

The sliders control the number of available agents, the arrival rate of calls, and the average service time of calls.

Observe how the call centre performs under different conditions, and which stress its ability to serve all clients.
